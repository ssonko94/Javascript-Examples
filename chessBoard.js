/**
 * Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid,
 * using newline characters to separate lines. 
 * At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character.
 * The characters should form a chessboard.
 * 
 * Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, 
define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, 
outputting a grid of the given width and height.
